## Tasks 
* Create a p5.js editor login and sign up to the Processing Foundation Forum 

  > p5.js/Processing Foundation editor account 
  >> Login - nech691@aucklanduni.ac.nz (U = Nech691)
  >> https://editor.p5js.org/ 
	>> https://discourse.processing.org/top?period=monthly
  
* Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals. Make sure to save your work
* Experiment with at least one of the following 2D primitive shapes from the p5.js documentation: **line**, triangle, quad, arc, (**rect**)
* Keep notes to document your process and learning clearly 
	
## Notes 
* Sketches 
  * We'll be using Java Script - mainly p5.js files (a set of tools)
  * The advantage of p5.js is that it gives us the ability to see the output of our code in real time; it also can be shared online 
  * References/documentation page on PF - https://p5js.org/reference/
  * The coding train YT channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw
	* Art + Code with Casey Hunt - HackadayU: Art+Code
	    
* ChatGPT - not as reliable as a source of information 
  * It can be used as a learning tool 

* Sketching with code (p5.js online editor)
  * Left = code
  * Right = preview
  * 2 pre-existing functions => set up (once) & draw (loop)
  * Colour = RGB values (e.g., 155, 0, 112)

* Functions
  * Rect(x, y, width, height)	=> *Create rectangle*
  * Stroke(R, G, B)	=> *RGB stroke colour*
  * Fill(R, G, B, transparency[0-255])	=> *RGB fill colour*
  * Let name = value =>	*Declare variables*
  * Name = name + 3	=> *Adding 3 to the value of the named variable*
    * *moves shape as they go through the loop*
  * Console.log(name) =>	*Logs the position of the name variable*
  * If(name > canvas size[or width]) {name = 0;} | if(mouseX > width / 2) {fill(255, 0, 0);} else {fill(255, 255, 0)}	=> *Conditionals/if statements*
    * *loops shape back to the starting position*
  * Ctrl + / or //	=> *Comment out the code*

* System variables 
	* MouseX -> rect(mouseX, bla, bla, bla)
	* MouseY -> rect(bla, mouseY, bla, bla)
	
* Order of operations 
	* Stroke
	* Fill
	* Shape 

## Project

 * For my first workshop task, I will create a Mondrian-inspired 400x400 canvas using the *rect()* and *line()* functions, thus exploring 2D primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals.
